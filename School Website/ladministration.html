<h2>Teacher Training Program</h2>
<P>
Sri Chaitanya Techno School is reputed to work on well–planned and well–defined academic curriculum with precision and proficiency. In view of the above norm, an expertise professionalism is the prerequisite of every mentor of our school.
</p>
<p>
The teacher training programme is an exchange programme where every trainee teacher gets to interact and share the best of the effective teaching skills and techniques with his or her colleague
</p>
<p>
We believe that such workshops are also instrumental in instructing, appraising and guiding teachers for a comprehensive and efficient class room teaching
</p>
<p>
Teachers are also trained and updated from time to time to ensure that they are well versed in the latest insights in the field of teaching and modern technology to shape them as a Techno – Saavy teacher
</p>
<p>
Varsity conducts several teacher training programmes for Sri Chaitanya teachers.
</p>
<h2>Adoption Program</h2>
<p>
Given the pressures and challengers that children face in this age, Sri Chaitanya Techno Schools have initiated a student Adoption Programme where every teacher handles 15 students.
</p>
<p>
Our Student Counselling Program is a full fledged unit led by the Staff. The Faculty members undergo intensive work out session during the summer, in order to handle the student with ease. 
</p>
<p>
The Staff works on different modules for the benefit of the child:
</p>
<p>
The modules include :
<ul style="font-size:19;color:#808080;text-align:left;"> 

	<li>Orientation</li>
	<li>Motivation</li>
	<li>Achievement</li>
	<li>Confidence Building</li>
	<li>Leadership Development</li>
	<li>Overcome Stress of the Examinations</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Each faculty member adopts 15 students. He / She prepares a statistical data of the child. Once in every fortnight the counselor takes up the counseling sessions. The student counselor is aware of the pulse of every child, that he / she has adopted. The child is given individual assistance during the time he is at school. The counselor plays the role of a confidant, philosopher, guide and has a remedy to the child's problems. 
</p>
<p>
The student adoption process at SCTS promotes and enhances student achievement. The counselling center believes that "What you were and what you are has no bearing at all on what you can be".

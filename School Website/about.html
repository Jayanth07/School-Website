<h2>Welcome the Masters of Education with a truly Global Vision Sri Chaitanya</h2>
<p>
There are some moments in life that one forgets. But for Sri Chaitanya every moment over the past 25 years has been memorable and cherished. Every year has not been a mere milestone but has hoisted another flag fluttering to mark educational conquest in the sands of time.
</p>
<h2>Flight through time</h2>
<p>
Sri Chaitanya first surfaced on the academic horizon in the Autumn of the 20th century and has progressed in a wink to the Spring of the 21st century in all dimensions earning itself the sobriquet : Asia's largest educational group. The past two and a half decades witnessed Sri Chaitanya striding across the sands of education like a Colossus with academic programmes that sent students to the nation's premier engineering and medical colleges in a torrential flow. It proved one thing : Sri Chaitanya is unstoppable at any level of scholastic activity. The manner in which the institution has weaved the academic programmes into the educational texture is sheer magic and part of academic folklore.
</p>
<h2>Legend of Sri Chaitanya – the Mentors</h2>
<p>
The inception of Sri Chaitanya was a vision of Sri Dr. B. S. Rao and Smt. Dr. Jhansi Lakshmi Bai, a handsome couple, who had been enjoying an immensely successful medical practice abroad. The transition from the field of medicine to education was swift and smooth. As professionals they were on a mission : to groom students of their home town in Andhra Pradesh, and change their mindset from settling for a mediocre career to aspiring for a professional career in premier engineering and medical institutions at the national level : and to transform mere participants to winners.
</p>
<p>
At the point of inception they set no boundaries for themselves : neither academic nor geographical. Their vision was to equip the students +2 of their state, academically, to make a mark in the prestigious professional institutions such as : IIT, AFMC, NIT, AIIMS etc. and bring forth their inherent talent and skills that would catapult them across the national frontiers to become global players.
</p>
<h2>Giving Students the global edge</h2>
<p>
Over the years Sri Chaitanya branched across the length and breadth of not only the state but beyond it. Thanks to their efficient academic and administrative squad, Sri Chaitanya is now a trusted house hold name across the country. The growth has been not uni but multi dimensional. The expansion of their educational services has touched the root level of education with the institution of Sri Chaitanya Techno Schools and Star Kids. Sri Chaitanya International Olympiad School, at Vijayawada was initiated to give students the International edge. Students at the Secondary School Level would be given orientation to ETS Tests like SAT, TOEFL, IELTS etc. so that it would not be a hindrance for them to pursue education abroad, in the future. This move spoke volumes about their earnest zeal and industry towards the student community.
</p>
<p>
The second generation of directors stepped in to support the founding directors of Sri Chaitanya and in no time set it on the fast track. The group now enjoys the perfect blend of wisdom and innovation. Thinking ahead of times is what they believe in. Customizing intellectual property is facilitating them relocate students from the unenviable situation of ordinary to the coveted education of the highest standard in premier national and state based professional institutions.
